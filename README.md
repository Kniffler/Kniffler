Hello people of the internet!
I go by @Kniffler but my gamertag is Lumenit so feel free to call me by either.
I make projects related to chess and *various* other stuff. So if you wanna find silly (and highly unreadable) code for your own projects, look no further!

Kniffler/Kniffler is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
